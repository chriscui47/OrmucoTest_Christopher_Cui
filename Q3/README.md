 Expiration was implemented using time() as well as removal of least recently used. The cache data structure was implemented using a doubly linked list as well as a dictionary to keep track of node keys. However, I was unable to implement GeoLocation.
 
# To initialize the tests, type: py -3 -m unittest GeoLRUCacheTests.py in your bash console
